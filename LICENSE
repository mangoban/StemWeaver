a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
   Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the

## 8. Termination

a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
   automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.

   release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing
   the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will
   not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has
   been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License),
   and this License will continue in full force and effect unless
   terminated as stated above.

============================================================

   applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability
   of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further
   action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
   reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision
   valid and enforceable.

d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
   breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing
   and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
