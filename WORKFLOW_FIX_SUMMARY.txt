GITHUB ACTIONS WORKFLOW - PATH FIX SUMMARY
================================================================================

ISSUE RESOLVED:
---------------
GitHub Actions failing with "build_appimage.sh: No such file or directory"

ROOT CAUSE:
-----------
Workflow was looking for build scripts in root directory, but all build scripts
are located in the packaging/ subdirectory.

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
---------------------

1. FIXED: build_appimage.sh references
   • Line 37: chmod +x packaging/build_appimage.sh
   • Line 38: ./packaging/build_appimage.sh
   • Line 98: chmod +x packaging/build_appimage.sh
   • Line 99: ./packaging/build_appimage.sh

2. FIXED: build_deb.sh references
   • Line 132: chmod +x packaging/build_deb.sh
   • Line 133: ./packaging/build_deb.sh

3. FIXED: build_rpm.sh references
   • Line 166: chmod +x packaging/build_rpm.sh
   • Line 167: ./packaging/build_rpm.sh

4. FIXED: build_arch.sh references
   • Line 200: chmod +x packaging/build_arch.sh
   • Line 201: ./packaging/build_arch.sh

WORKFLOW STRUCTURE:
-------------------
Jobs (6 total):
  • build-docker-package → GitHub Packages
  • build-appimage → GitHub Releases
  • build-deb → GitHub Releases
  • build-rpm → GitHub Releases
  • build-arch → GitHub Releases
  • create-release → Creates GitHub Release

Triggers:
  • Tag push (v*)
  • Manual trigger via GitHub UI

BUILD SCRIPT LOCATIONS:
-----------------------
All build scripts are in: /home/bendeb/stemweaver/packaging/
  • build_appimage.sh
  • build_deb.sh
  • build_rpm.sh
  • build_arch.sh
  • tools/ (linuxdeploy, appimagetool)

VERIFICATION:
-------------
✓ All build script references use correct packaging/ prefix
✓ Workflow YAML is valid
✓ All 6 jobs properly defined
✓ Dependencies and sequencing correct
✓ Tag v1.1.0 recreated and pushed
✓ Changes committed to main branch

EXPECTED EXECUTION:
-------------------
1. GitHub Actions detects tag v1.1.0 push
2. All 5 build jobs execute in sequence
3. Docker image pushed to GitHub Packages
4. Release created with all artifacts
5. Total execution time: 5-10 minutes

MONITORING:
-----------
