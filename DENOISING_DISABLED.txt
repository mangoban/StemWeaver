DENOISING FEATURE - DISABLED
============================

Date: January 11, 2026
Status: DISABLED

Reason:
- Denoising was adding noise to ALL stems (not just vocals)
- Feature was causing quality issues
- Needs complete redesign

What was disabled:
1. GUI checkbox for denoising
2. GUI slider for denoise level
3. Denoising in processing loop
4. All denoising functions (apply_denoising, apply_neural_denoising, etc.)

Current state:
- All stems are saved clean without any denoising
- No denoising options available in GUI
- Vocal-first mode still works perfectly
- All other features working correctly

Future:
- Denoising will be revisited with proper implementation
- Will ensure it ONLY affects vocals
- Will add proper testing before release

For now: Use clean separation without denoising.
